# Nutritional-Sleep
The sleep themed, sheep themed fasting tracker &amp; fan page 



zZz this app is about rest and healing.

// was going to write this as the commit but it's very important to know so keeping it internal:
this app, like waterapp/WAPP/fill_cont:

simple, whimsical design that expresses time based functionality

both a water app and fasting app will have:
start_time, end_time, reminder related functionality.

there's seemingly little to implement:
 so much space can be lent to large images.

original WAPP/water app which I didn't design
makes use of a settings bar that pops up as 1 of navbar icons.

when the calendar pops up half the middle screen just says:
"Pick a Highlighted Day"

The dashboard that is the current data for current water cycle
or in nutritional sleep iteration would be current fast.

dashboard & calendar will be almost the whole app.
// GotchaSheep -----> TomaGatchi knockoff: sheep.feed() && tend heart bar levels. [might link this to "food list" and allow human to feed sheep the food it would've eaten while fasting]

bookmarking a message to myself that in noticing:

mine-nugget-ts:
// no use for calendar.
page 1: displays every piece of API data from fs.json or postgres besides the data.strain.parentGeneticsOfStrain
page 2: creates a simple guessing game out of providing the data.strain.parentData withHeld from display from page. User can guess child based on parents.
page 3: search page with magnifying glass. toggle between seeing reviews/likes from other users with other strains. 

I bookmark in this commit that I think I'd be slightly more proficient in computer programming if I allowed a sorting system that designated the next app to create: (calendar or no calendar?)
