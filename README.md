zZz this app is about rest and healing.

// was going to write this as the commit but it's very important to know so keeping it internal:
this app, like waterapp/WAPP/fill_cont:

simple, whimsical design that expresses time based functionality

both a water app and fasting app will have:
start_time, end_time, reminder related functionality.

there's seemingly little to implement:
 so much space can be lent to large images.

original WAPP/water app which I didn't design
makes use of a settings bar that pops up as 1 of navbar icons.

when the calendar pops up half the middle screen just says:
"Pick a Highlighted Day"

The dashboard that is the current data for current water cycle
or in nutritional sleep iteration would be current fast.

dashboard & calendar will be almost the whole app.
