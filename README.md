#### if only this fasting app could answer this question:
3% of workaholics feel physically ill when they are not at work, mimicking withdrawal symptoms that are associated with addictive drugs.
# after 3 hours code feel uplifted, relaxed, "calm and alert - huberman". Startup rn so 9-12 more hrs code to go but QUESTION:
(after establishing context through Anna Lembke's words: bombard brain with dopamine it adapts by downregulating)

    So theoretically I feel normal after blasting brain with dopamine from coding over and over. How long would feeling normal last without coding and without stimulation before the urge & feeling to stimulate & work resurfaces?
 did wim-hof breathe and realized after 3 hours of code today I feel super normal. I can't test right now since attempting-startup but experiment would be: 
 // 1 how long does it take to feel "normal" (maybe I didn't pay attention 2 hours ago and it takes 60 mins)
 // once one feels "normal" how long does that last, without stimulation, before one feels urge to stimulate ?

 // note this is a non-startup fasting app that might have cute-shirt as mock-ecommerce projects and possibly contact form for "coaching" but it won't be serious just as measure of proof-of-concept

// sidenote: working on attempted startup of social app first then this non-startup-design-heavy-fasting-app will probably be done next
// POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS: 
TL:DR; no XP using but researching device, seems that whoop overexpects sleep as a static number influenced only by heart rate 
(which is valid to an extent ecxluding some below, and cites a counter provided by Dr Michael Breus "sleep doctor" experiences)
whoop wearable, don't have but currently researching, apparently expect a TON of sleep. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl0C3Hv0Hxk 
// in this episode, actual Dr. Michael Breus ("The Sleep Doctor") "I sleep at midnight every day, up at 6:15, drink water bottle, get sun I'm fine"  
// excerpts from google: "In fact, the average sleep need for WHOOP members is 8:34 per night"
// one could say with that information that it's a clean 25% drop from the 8 hours. 

Again: !startup,  !need-filling-attempt just a love-letter to fasting with a design concept iterated through sleep (but maybe it's accurate enough too

notes on the matter:
- my whoop worry: since Icurrently sleep fine on 6.5-8 usually 7(ish) hours which whoop would say increase "speak into existence" start feeling worse in reseponse

working on starting a meditation habit and aparently

from GEMINI/google first result:
Meditation and Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) are different practices that can both promote relaxation and rejuvenation, but it's hard to say how much meditation is//

// analogy b/w "rest as in digestion or as in sleep" if app actually incorporates sleep data. the sleep based play on words nullifies & becomes literal

##### Water-App:
water app needs an update which would allow "activity level" to influence water intake during a water scheduling app based on height, weight, age, activity, etc.
Similarly to awaiting water app features, wishlisting fasting app includes activity levels as well to create algo which limits activity in recognition of sarcopenia 
// note this is not a startup not anything medically legitimate just playing with info created from behaviors like fasting or sipping water and UI.
// // while writing up this commit: of course allow integration with AI models or wearables like whoop|fitbit

zZz this app is about rest and healing.

// was going to write this as the commit but it's very important to know so keeping it internal:
this app, like waterapp/WAPP/fill_cont:

simple, whimsical design that expresses time based functionality

both a water app and fasting app will have:
start_time, end_time, reminder related functionality.

there's seemingly little to implement:
 so much space can be lent to large images.

original WAPP/water app which I didn't design
makes use of a settings bar that pops up as 1 of navbar icons.

when the calendar pops up half the middle screen just says:
"Pick a Highlighted Day"

The dashboard that is the current data for current water cycle
or in nutritional sleep iteration would be current fast.

dashboard & calendar will be almost the whole app.
// GotchaSheep -----> TomaGatchi knockoff: 
1:sheep.feed() && tend heart bar levels. [might link this to "food list" and allow human to feed sheep the food it would've eaten while fasting]
2 human stays happy fasting. Sheep helps human.


bookmarking a message to myself that in noticing:

* * Always Ask ! : is this a need-a-calendar or not kind of App. How can Component-Composition or Context be used with the data tables or state in the app ? * * 

mine-nugget-ts:
// no use for calendar.
page 1: displays every piece of API data from fs.json or postgres besides the data.strain.parentGeneticsOfStrain
page 2: creates a simple guessing game out of providing the data.strain.parentData withHeld from display from page. User can guess child based on parents.
page 3: search page with magnifying glass. toggle between seeing reviews/likes from other users with other strains.

AM | PM timing:

To render fasting data make an array that has [progress] and weekly status. Loop over the data array and check for progress and status to determine whether UI shows successful or not fast 
`  const renderSchedule = () => {
    
    return HYDRO_SCHEDULE.map((time:any, index:number) => (
      
      <ConnectedReminder
        key={index}
        time={time}
        amt={(hydroIntake / hydroSchedule.length) * (index + 1)}
        amtper={hydroIntake / hydroSchedule.length}
        percent={Math.floor(
          (((hydroIntake / hydroSchedule.length) * (index + 1)) / hydroIntake) *
            100 -

// loose update:
seretonin boost as seen in increased BDNF and seretonin of ramadan participants.
sought above by asking "when does seretonin boost from fasting" to google:
first search result: 5-10 day plasma-seretonin boost.
while digging found the information related to ramadan which is more a 12-17hr (but dry?) fast 
Imagine the UI telling you: You're feeling:
more connected, more comfortable, more confident, more consistent, NO COINCIDENCE! 
// it sounds crazy till you realize our advertisements bombard us with absolute opposite
